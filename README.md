# Instacart Sales Analysis: Python Project for Customer Insights and Marketing Strategies
## Introduction
This project analyzes Instacart’s sales and customer data using Python to uncover key insights about purchasing patterns. The goal is to help Instacart stakeholders develop targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. As an analyst, my role involves exploring the data, visualizing trends, and generating actionable recommendations.

## Objectives

This analysis addresses the following key questions:

    What are the busiest days and times for orders?
    When do customers spend the most money?
    How can products be grouped into price ranges?
    Which product categories are the most popular?
    How do customer demographics (e.g., loyalty, region, family status) affect ordering habits?

## Data and tools used

The project uses datasets from Instacart, including orders data (Information on order timing and spending), customers data (demographics, loyalty status, and regions) and products data (price ranges, categories, and departments). 

The data was analysed using Python and the following libraries:

    Pandas: for data analysis
    Numpy: for mathematical equations
    Seaborn: for data visualizations
    Matplotlib: for data visualizations
    SciPy: for mathematical equations
