# Instacart Sales Analysis: Python Project for Customer Insights and Marketing Strategies
## Introduction
This project analyzes Instacart’s sales and customer data using Python to uncover key insights about purchasing patterns. The goal is to help Instacart stakeholders develop targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. As an analyst, my role involves exploring the data, visualizing trends, and generating actionable recommendations.

## Objectives

This analysis addresses the following key questions:

-   What are the busiest days and times for orders?
-   When do customers spend the most money?
-   How can products be grouped into price ranges?
-   Which product categories are the most popular?
-   How do customer demographics (e.g., loyalty, region, family status) affect ordering habits?

## Description of folder contents are as follows:

 -   01 Project Management: Contains the project brief and related documentation.
 -   02 Data: Includes two subfolders: (Data not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
        'Original Data': Original datasets.
        'Prepared Data': Cleaned data ready for analysis.
 -   03 Scripts: Python code for the analysis, executed using Jupyter notebooks.
 -   04 Analysis: Contains the 'Visualizations' subfolder with visualizations used for exploratory analysis and explaining            insights.
 -   05 Sent to Client: Final Excel presentation.

## Data and tools used

The project uses datasets from Instacart, including orders data (Information on order timing and spending), customers data (demographics, loyalty status, and regions) and products data (price ranges, categories, and departments). 

The data was analysed using Python and the following libraries:

 -  Pandas: for data analysis
 -  Numpy: for mathematical equations
 -  OS: For interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations
 -  Seaborn: for data visualizations
 -   Matplotlib: for data visualizations
 -  SciPy: for mathematical equations

## Disclaimer

Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online, however customer data is fictitious and used for the purposes of Career Foundry's Data Analytics program.
